# Time Capsule Backend üöÄ - Architecture for this API

**"Time Capsule"** is a student project developed by <a href="https://sofiavazs.netlify.app/">Sofia Vaz Sousa</a> and <a href="https://vanessa-portfolio.netlify.app/">Vanessa Sue Smith</a>.

For our _Time Capsule_ Backend we are working with a __RESTful API__ built with _Express_ on _Node.js_. We are storing our data in a Mongo Database structured with mongoose.
~~Server deployed to _Heroku_~~ and _MongoDB_ stored in _Atlas_.

**‚ö† UPDATE:** Unfortunately, due to the removal of Heroku's free dynos, we had to shut this server down üíî So the server is momentarily not deployed, and the app is only partially functional.

We work with 3 main collections in our database: __User__, __BabyProfile__ and __DailyEntry__.
We have connected the collections by creating a relation to the User model, so for example each DailyEntry entry includes an entryBy property, which lists
the ID of the user who authored this entry.

We have implemented validation where possible on each of our models, in order to control that the data stored in our database is clean and proper ‚ú®

## Frontend - See it in Action üí•

You can find the Time Capsule Frontend repository here, where we have put this API to the test üí™: https://github.com/VanessaSue27/final-project-frontend

And a deployed LIVE version of it here: https://time-capsule-final.netlify.app/
